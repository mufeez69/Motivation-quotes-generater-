# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Using Generative AI

This application uses Google's Generative AI models. To use them, you need to provide an API key.

1.  Create an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Open the `.env` file in the root of this project.
3.  Paste your API key into the `GEMINI_API_KEY` field.

The app will now use your key for all AI-powered features.
